## `local chipmunk = require'chipmunk'`

A ffi binding of the Chipmunk2D physics engine.

## Status

Currently, there's the usual windows binary and build script, sanitized
header for ffi, module stub exporting the ffi clib object, and a demo stub.
A Lua-friendly API is missing.

## API

It's in the [Chipmunk2D Manual](http://chipmunk-physics.net/release/ChipmunkLatest-Docs/).
