harfbuzz 0.9.25 from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ (MIT License)
requires: ucdn

NOTE: mingw32 has a MemoryBarrier() definition that harfbuzz can't work with,
so I changed harfbuzz (hb-atomic-private.hh line 50) to use its own definition in that case.
Mingw-w64 works fine.

NOTE: ragel is needed to compile the .rl files after updating harfbuzz to a new version.
