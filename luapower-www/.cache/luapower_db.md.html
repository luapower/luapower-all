<p>This package holds <code>luapower_db.lua</code>, which is a file generated by luapower’s continous-integration servers by successively running <code>./luapower update-db</code> on each platform supported by luapower, on a common luapower source tree that is <em>share-mounted on all platforms</em> (which is what allows this file to get updated with information from multiple platforms).</p>
<p>Cloning this repo along with <a href="/luapower">luapower</a> will enable the <code>luapower</code> command and module to give full dependency information for all platforms on any package, otherwise you will only get information that is specific to your platform.</p>
<p>For information on how to set up a CI system for luapower, see <a href="https://github.com/luapower/ci_linux">ci_linux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/luapower/ci_osx">ci_osx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/luapower/ci_windows">ci_windows</a>, <a href="https://github.com/luapower/luapower-ci">luapower-ci</a>.</p>
