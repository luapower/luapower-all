<p>Data-driven web components in pure JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Better <a href="http://luapower.com/x-widgets-demo.html">check out the demo</a> before anything, which also includes some quick-reference documentation.</p>
<p>This library is designed for data-dense business-type apps with a focus on data entry and data navigation.</p>
<p>Such apps need higher information density, higher signal-to-noise ratio, faster loading times and lower operational latencies than the usual consumer-centric web-apps, and as such, tend to favor tabbed and split-pane layouts over newspaper-type layouts, optimize for keyboard navigation, and are generally designed for an office setting with a big screen, a chair and a keyboard and mouse (“keyboard &amp; mouse”-first apps).</p>
<p>So what this means is: none of that responsive stuff, keyboard is king, no touchy the screen, and no megabytes of polyfills to implement half a browser because you want to squeeze that last drop of the market or deliver a few more ads.</p>
<h2 id="browser-compatibility">Browser Compatibility</h2>
<p>This will probably only work on desktop Firefox and Chrome/Edge for the forseeable future. Something might be done for Safari and maybe mobile Chrome and Firefox too. Anything else is out.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Look, it’s just a bunch of .css and .js files. Load them as they are or combine, minify and gzip them, you know, do what you have to do, make it look professional.</p>
<p>The dependencies are <code>glue.js</code> and <code>divs.js</code> from <a href="/webb">webb</a> so get those first. Get <code>rowset.js</code> too if you want to use the widgets in data-driven mode. <code>glue.js</code> extends JavaScript with basic routines similar to <a href="/glue">glue</a> from Lua. <code>divs.js</code> is a tiny jQuery-like library for DOM manipulation. <code>rowset.js</code> contains the client-side row-set abstraction that makes the widgets data-driven.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>Even though they’re web components, the widgets don’t use shadow DOMs so both their sub-elements and their styling are up for grabs. All widgets get the <code>.x-widget</code> class that you can set global styling like a custom font to, without disturbing your other styles.</p>
<h2 id="web-developers-beware">Web developers beware</h2>
<p>If you’re a web developer (as opposed to say, a programmer), you might want to stay away from this library. This library’s author doesn’t have much respect for “design patterns”, “best practices”, “code smells” and other such <em>thinking-avoidance mechanisms</em> often employed by web developers. If you’re still not sure, here’s a list to <s>test the limits of your dogmatism</s> see how unprofessional I am:</p>
<ul>
<li>this lib pollutes the global namespace like it’s London 1858.</li>
<li>this lib extends built-in classes with new methods.</li>
<li>this lib only uses <code>===</code> when it’s actually necessary.</li>
<li>this lib uses <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> for layouting. are you sick yet?</li>
<li>this lib uses snake case instead of hungarian notation.</li>
<li>this lib wraps instantation with <code>new</code> into plain functions.</li>
<li>this lib does not even quote html attributes. why are you still reading?</li>
<li>this lib uses a deployment system whereby you open up your file explorer and then you copy-paste a bunch of .css and .js files to your goddam www folder.</li>
<li>look, it’s not even a framework, it’s a library. don’t you wanna use a framework?</li>
</ul>
