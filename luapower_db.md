tagline: the luapower package database
---

This package holds `luapower_db.lua`, which is a file generated by luapower's
continous-integration servers by successively running `./luapower update-db`
on each platform supported by luapower, on a common luapower source tree that
is _share-mounted on all platforms_ (which is what allows this file to get
updated with information from multiple platforms).

Cloning this repo along with [luapower] will enable the `luapower` command
and module to give full dependency information for all platforms on any
package, otherwise you will only get information that is specific to your
platform.

For information on how to set up a CI system for luapower, see
[ci_linux], [ci_osx], [ci_windows], [luapower-ci].
