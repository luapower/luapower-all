Bugs
==============================================================================

- test script modifier.

- test BIDI:
	- BIDI justify (last line also)
	* BIDI reorder
	* BIDI keyboard navigation
	* BIDI mouse drag-selection

- cursor back-one-word from last position steps back 2 steps.

- span-at-cursor.

- fixed line height: per-layout or per-paragraph font_id/font_size.

- mixed argb/alpha segments: argb part pre-rendered into alpha bitmap.

High priority
==============================================================================

- follow tabstops

- strikethrough

- partial reshaping on text editing

- tofu box with hex codepoint for missing glyphs.
	see: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-May/004859.html

Low priority
==============================================================================

- more underline/strikethrough types:
	double, dotted, dashed, double_dotted, double_dashed.

- better line wrapping
	implement SMAWK or binary search from here: https://xxyxyz.org/line-breaking/

- underline to skip descendants
	Needs fast outline-to-horizontal-line intersection algorithm + caching the results.

- vertical layouts
	gravity, gravity_hint?

- hyphenation
	- mandatory for word-wrapping of east-asian scripts with no spaces
	between words (Thai, Lao, Khmer, Burmese, etc.)
	- see: http://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/typography/linebreak.en

- floating shapes inside text or text inside shapes
	- line-to-poly intersection with winding rule to cover both inside/outside cases.

- word wrapping inside words (css word-break: break-all).

- letter-spacing (see https://github.com/luapower/tr/issues/20)
	- disable letter-spacing for cursive scripts
	- disable ligatures (-liga) for letter-spaced scripts

- Unicode debugging / visual editing aids
	mark invisible characters positions:
		ZW-NBSP: prevents ligatures
		NBSP: prevents word-wrapping
		SOFT HYPHEN: hyphenate if word-wrapping
		ZWJ: force joining
		ZWNJ: prevent joining
		WORD JOINER: ZW-NBSP-like
		LTR/RTL modifiers
		variation selectors
		hangul fillers
	mark look-alike characters:   ; ꓸ ꓹ ꓽ (called "confusables" in Unicode, see confusables.txt)
	mark runs by script and language
	at cursor:
		show direction
		show all codepoints individually between cursor and next cursor
		shape/show all graphemes individually between cursor and next cursor

Very-low priority
==============================================================================

Allow varying the formatting attributes within a single grapheme
	IOW allow coloring the diacritical marks differently than the base glyph.

Flag to apply opacity to an entire span:
	Currently the opacity attribute is applied to individual glyphs, not
	whole runs, which results in visible seams when glyphs overlap in
	cursive fonts. What we want is a flag that paints a whole run on a temp
	surface with opacity 1 and then paints that surface at specified opacity.
	This is a rare use case when a text using a cursive font has only
	certain parts translucent.

Glyph substitution:
	- font_override text attribute for manual override.
	- register fallback fonts for script/language and try them in order.
	- match original font's size, weight, slant, stretch.
	- cache the substitutions.
	- custom paint_glyph() callback for missing glyphs

Font hinting option for when registering a font:
	'no-hinting', 'auto-hinting', 'bytecode-hinting', 'auto-bytecode-hinting', 'bytecode-auto-hinting'

`multiline` option
	Make a multiline option to be used by ui_editbox, which currently uses
	nowrap but in addition it has to filter newline characters in order to
	avoid multiple line rendering.
	The idea is to have a single-line editbox which can accept any unicode
	character. This needs the custom glyph substitution feature so that
	newline chars can be drawn.

Implement rule L1 from UBA?
	This is a thing which we don't yet implement. It's a very subtle point
	which will probably not even be visible to most people.
	This rule1 makes it so that trailing whitespace will appear at the visual
	end of the line (in paragraph direction). This rule is only visible in a
	mixed RTL/LTR line (soft or hard wrapped) with multiple space characters
	after the last word. In current implementation, that trailing whitespace
	stays with the last word instead of moving to the end of the line.
	This also means that the last cursor position on the line is not at the
	end of the line either.
	We might want to change this in the future, but only if it becomes a
	problem as it complicates the implementation a bit.

Bounding-box API
	Not useful for now, but maybe in the future.

Spell-checking
	Features: highlighting, autocompletion, autocorrection, autoignore, manual ignore.
	Probably tr is NOT the right place to implement this: from tr's pov this
	is just text with funky underlines.

Vertical alignment top/bottom margin option:
	- spacing_ascent/spacing_descent (what we use now)
	- ascent/descent (tighter)
	- paragraph_ascent/paragraph_descent (looser)

Horizontal alignment left/right margin option
	* advance: current solution, works with mixed-dir lines.
	* bounding-box: exclude side bearings eg. so that a trailing "f" doesn't
	overflow the enclosing box. I don't know how to implement for mixed-dir
	lines because of bidi reordering.

Arbitrary path baseline
	This can be useful eg. for names on maps.
	General idea: use the same breaking points as for letter-spacing.
	translate & rotate glyphs to match path's normals at glyph's center.

Advanced arbitrary path baseline
	- extract glyphs outlines
	- break outlines into polygons
	- distort points based on path's normal vectors
	- rasterize new distorted outline

Text rotation at arbitrary angles using rotated outlines
	One idea is to convert glyph runs to cairo path objects and rasterize
	with cairo instead of freetype.

Shaping words separately breaks contextual ligatures
	* see: https://github.com/luapower/tr/issues/15
	* see: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761442
	* there's talk about a harfbuzz "context" option but I can't see it.
	* this also disables some advanced features such as word kerning and collision avoidance.

- cache poisoning for font ids
	use case: reaching the 2G font_id limit, i.e. 2,000 million custom fonts
	were loaded in a single run of the app but the font cache still holds
	a few ref-counted fonts (eg. the fonts that show the main menu which
	never goes away). now we have to restart the app. honestly if your app
	could last that long before crashing, you're in business.
